Winrate prediction model and statistics lookup for the popular MOBA League of Legends.


Unfortunately, due to numerous in-game changes and updates to the API, this project only works with data received before Patch 14.10.
That being said, the Winrate prediction model and League Chatbot are still fully functional.
